# Project Rule: Figma-Aligned TypeScript Design System

## Source of Truth
- Figma tokens and components are the primary reference.
- Do not introduce new colors, spacing values, typography scales, radii, or motion values unless they match Figma or are approved extensions.

## Token Usage
- All style values must reference typed tokens (color, spacing, typography, radius, motion).
- Avoid hard-coded values such as hex codes, numeric spacing, or arbitrary durations.
- Tokens must come from a centralized token module with full TypeScript typing.

## Component Architecture
- Each component must map directly to its Figma definition.
- Component props must reflect Figma variants, states, and interactions.
- Components must be written as pure, composable TypeScript/React functions.
- Ensure strict naming consistency with Figma variant names.

## Documentation Requirements
- Each component must include:
  - A clear purpose statement.
  - Prop definitions with TypeScript types.
  - Developers must be able to select and copy examples directly from definition.
  - Allowed token references.
  - Usage examples and code snippets.
  - Documentation must be accessible to designers and developers through the web project.
  - Usage guidelines for both designers and developers.
